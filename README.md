# A basic Link hub 
Made a simple Login and register page using HTML CSS and  JS 
To store user data I used Firebase and firestore because I don't want to integrate with back-end tech
It is a simple login page and after a user logged it will show you some links which is related to study like coding or other things.
After clicking that particular link it will redirect to there pages.
It is just a basic for learning purpose only.
